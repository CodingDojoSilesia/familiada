Coding Dojo Silesia: Familiada Kata
===================================

Welcome to A'th edition of Coding Dojo Silesia. Your task is to implement a simulation
of a [polish version of Family Feud TV game show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiada).
We provided a simple boilerplate in ES with a HTML version of the interface, but you
can implement your own GUI if you choose too. Just remember, this is a kata, we care about
quality of your code and value simplicity over complexity.

Please read the whole description before you start working.

### The rules
1. There are two teams, red and blue.
1. First team to score 300 points wins, we do not implement the finale part.
1. First team to play the round is chosen at random.
1. The points in round 4 are doubled. Starting round 5 the points are tripled.
1. Each round consists of one question, which has several answers.
1. The answers points vary on their previously surveyed popularity.
1. You can find the questions and answers in the [data.json](src/data.json) in the src 
   directory.

##### The round scenario
1. The selected team members give their answers to the question.
1. Each correct answer is uncovered on the board and the points sum is displayed on the
   board as well.
1. Each incorrect answer is counted as a mistake and is visible on the page as an X.
1. If the team guesses all the answer, the whole sum of points is awarded and the round
   ends.
1. If the team makes 3 mistakes, the opposite team can give 1 answer.
   * If the answer is correct, the team steal all the awarded points from the board.
   * Otherwise, the team that was originally playing the round gets these points.
   * In both cases the round ends as well.

### The twist
Just like a live show, the answers will be given vocally, To achieve the a 
[Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API)
will be used. Take note, that this API is only available on Google Chrome
and Firefox, although we were not able to make it work in Firefox. Using the latest
stable version of Google Chrome is strongly advised if you want to use this feature.
Given that we don't want to force you to install a Google software on your machine, 
this part if the task is serving as a twist for those interested and is not required.

### The second twist
As we know in Poland, this TV show cannot exist without some bad jokes ;) Should you
find yourself with some additional time on your hands, consider throwing some cool
dry joke at the start of the show using the awesome 
[random-suchar-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-suchar-generator)
written by an awesome member of our community and a mentor 
[Arek](https://github.com/lazarow).

Because we're using the browser environment, you'll probably find using the
[endpoint provided by us](http://suchary.dmazur.usermd.net/) easier to use.

### The manual
##### Installation
1. Be sure you have your node.js updated. The use of [n](https://github.com/tj/n) 
   is advised. Just be sure to restart your terminal, should you change the node version.
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

##### Entry point
The main JS is [main.js](src/scripts/main.js) in the `src/scripts` directory.

##### Testing
Existing tests are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), but you are allowed to
use any testing framework, as long as you do write the tests ;)

### Credits
Thank you to [Arek](https://github.com/lazarow) for Web Speech API idea as well as
the [generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-suchar-generator).  

Also, huge thanks to everyone involved in making this Dojo a possibility! Mentors, 
organizers, and all the people discussing topic ideas with us and taking active part
in our community. You know who you are ;)
